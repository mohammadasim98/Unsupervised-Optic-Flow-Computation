### CNN based computation of Optic Flow by unsupervised means using Multi-Scale Deep Energy Reduction

## Introduction
Optic flow computation is a technique to find the relative movement of each pixel in a video frame with respect to the previous frame. The idea is to detect the direction and amount of displacement that happens in a subsequent pair of video frames. The displacement vector is represented by a 3-dimensional (m x n x 2) array whose first channel represent the displacement in x-direction and the second channel represents the y-direction.
